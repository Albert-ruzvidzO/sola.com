		<div id="tbp">
		<p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious airborne disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a bacterium that grows and divides inside of cells.
		 The infection, which starts in the lungs, causes nodules known as tubercles, or Ghon focii, which are spots left by dead infected tissue. With time,
		 the disease can spread to other areas of the lung and larger areas of lung tissue may die off, causing cavities. Bacteria can also spread to other
		 organs, including the kidney, brain, and spine.</p>
		<p>Antibiotics are used for tuberculosis, though treatment is not always simple or effective. TB is not something that is typically vaccinated
		 against in the United States and it can be fatal if left untreated.</p>
		<p>Tuberculosis is an airborne disease, spread primarily via droplets released into the air after a contagious person coughs, spits,
		 or sneezes. The risk for infection is greatest for those who spend long periods of time in closed environments—such as an airplane, bus,
		 or small living space—with infected people.</p>
		<p>TB is a serious health problem in many countries, especially developing ones. It has been called a “disease of poverty” because it is more 
		prevalent in places with challenging socioeconomic conditions that lead to a crowded living, malnutrition and more. While tuberculosis is less 
		prevalent in the United States, it remains a problem in hospitals, prisons, and homeless shelters, where crowded conditions prevail.</p>
		<p>Those with weakened immune systems are especially at risk for TB. This includes children, the elderly, those with an immune-compromising disease
		 or condition (like HIV), those taking immunosuppressive drugs (such as in the treatment of an autoimmune disease or after an organ transplant)
		 and people undergoing cancer treatment.</p>

		<div id="ptbdiagnosis">
		<p>If you suspect that you have active TB, call your healthcare provider to arrange for a TB test. The most commonly used one is the interferon-gamma
		 release assays (IGRAs) test, a blood test that measures a person’s immune reactivity to <span ="italics"> M. tuberculosis.</span></p> 
		<p>The IGRA test has largely replaced the Mantoux skin test, which is performed by injecting a purified protein derivative of mycobacterium 
		tuberculosis under the skin on your forearm. If you have an immune reaction, swelling will result at the injection site within two to three days.
		Sometimes the skin test may be given too soon after exposure to the bacteria (before eight to 10 weeks) for an immune response to develop.</p>
		<p>If you do test positive, you will undergo further testing, including a chest X-ray and a bacterial culture or microscopic examination of coughed-up
		 sputum (phlegm).</p>

		<h2><p style="color: red;">Tuberculosis Treatment</p></h2>
		</div>

		<div id="ptbtreatment">
		<p>Tuberculosis is treated with antibiotics. Treatment usually consists of six to eight weeks of a combination of four drugs, followed by two of the
		 medications for 18 weeks, for a total duration of six to nine months.</p>
		<p>The exact course prescribed to you depends on your case and overall health.</p>

		<div id="pmalaria">
		<p>Malaria is an infection caused by a parasite that almost always is transmitted by mosquitoes. It's rare in the United States, where only about 1,700
		 cases are reported each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). By contrast, the World Health Organization reports
		 that there are more than 200 million cases of malaria around the globe annually, and more than 400,000 deaths.</p>
		<p>When someone in the United States comes down with malaria, it's usually because they were infected while visiting a region of the world where the
		 disease is still common. The CDC says that approximately half of all travelers who contract malaria are immigrants who had visited friends and family
		 in their country of origin.</p>
		<p>It's always a good idea to be aware of the symptoms, complications and other aspects of any potential illness. So, if you are traveling to a
		 country where malaria is commonplace, you will want to take certain precautions, such as packing plenty of insect repellent and possibly getting a 
		vaccination before you leave.</p>

		<div id="pmalariasymptoms">
		<p>Most symptoms of malaria are the result of toxins that the parasite produces when it invades red blood cells. These toxins can cause anemia and,
		 in many cases, blockages in small blood vessels throughout the body. Complications that are associated with malaria include the following:</p>

		<ol type="a">
		<li>Anemia</li>
		<li>Thrombocytopenia, a condition in which a low blood platelet count interferes with normal clotting of blood</li>
		<li>Kidney problems</li>
		<li>Cerebral malaria (This isn't common but can be devastating or even fatal.)</li>
		<li>Coma, loss of consciousness, or death</li>
		</ol>

		<h2><p style="color: red;">Causes of Malaria</p></h2>
		</div>

		<div id="pmalariacauses">
		<p>There are four species of the Plasmodium parasite, the specific organism that causes malaria. The most common way to become infected is by being
		 bitten by a female Anopheles mosquito that would have picked up the parasite by biting another person who is infected.</p>
		<p>Once the infective form of a Plasmodium parasite enters the body, it hunkers down in the liver, reproduces, and then enters the red blood cells.
		 At this point, symptoms of malaria will begin to appear.</p>
		<p>Besides direct infection from a mosquito bite, it's possible for malaria to be transmitted via a blood transfusion, though it's very rare in the
		 United States. Babies sometimes acquire the parasite from their mothers before birth. People with immune system deficiencies, including women who 
		are pregnant, are more likely to develop malaria after being bitten. </p>

		<h2><p style="color: red;">Treatment of Malaria</p></h2>
		</div>

		<div id="pmalariatreatment">
		<p>Malaria is treated with a combination of home remedies and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs for managing symptoms and prescription medications. 
		To alleviate symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and headache, taking steps such as getting plenty of fluids, eating well, managing your body temperature
		 with blankets if you're chilled or ice packs if you're feverish, resting, and taking OTC pain relievers and anti-fever medications can help.</p>

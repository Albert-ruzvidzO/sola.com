		<div id="bpmainbody">
		<p>Hypertension is the medical or clinical term for “ high blood pressure." It is a very common medical problem 
			and a leading cause of heart attack, strock, and chronic kidney disease.</p>
		<P>Most people who have hypertension only develop symptoms when their condition progresses enough to cause damage 
		to inner walls of their arteries. In many instances, the first sign of hypertension is a sudden heart attack or stroke. This is why it is
		 referred to as “ the silent killer.”</P>
		<P> When it comes to treating hypertension, the good news is that there are a vast number of prescription medications available and
		    guidelines have been developed to help doctors quickly find an effective and well-tolerated treatment for almost anyone with this condition.</P>

		<div id="bpcauses">
		<h2><p style="color: #ff0000;">Common  causes </p><h2>
		</div>

		<div id="pbpcauses">
		<p>Hypertension generally develops without a known cause and gradually worsens over the years. A number of knownn risk factors are associated 
		   with higher likelihood of developing essential hypertension and there are several health conditions that cause secondary hypertension.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="bpage">
		<h3><p style="color: #ff0000;">1:Age</p></h3>
		</div>
		
		<div id="pbpage">
		<p>The risk of hypertension increases as you get older. In general, this is related to a number of effects of aging.</p>
		</div>

		<div id ="bpgender">
		<h3><p style="color: #ff0000;">2:Gender</p></h3>
		</div>

		<div id = "pbpgender">
		<p>Hypertension is more common in men than in women until the age of 45. Thereafter and until age 64, the percentage of men
		 and women maybe  more likely to develop hypertension after age 60.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="bprace">
		<h3><p style="color: #ff0000;">3:Race</p></h3>
		</div>

		<div id="pbprace">
		<p>Blacks and Whites are more likely to develop hypertension than Latinos. People  of Asian descent are less likely to develop hypertension.
		 The differences in the risk of hypertension between people of different races are believed to be caused by a combination of genetic, dietary,
		 and lifestyle factors.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="bpkidneydisease">
		<h3><p style="color: #ff0000;">4:Kidney Disease</p></h3>
		</div>

		<div id="pbpkidneydisease">
		<p>Chronic kidney disease affects the fluid and electrolyte volume and concentration in the body, which places excess pressure on the arteries,
		 causing hypertension.</p>
		</div>	

		<div id="bpdiabetes">
		<h3><p style="color: #ff0000;">5:Diabetes</p></h3>
		</div>

		<div id="pbpdiabetes">
		<p>Diabetes increases the risk of hypertension. This is partially due to the effect of diabetes on  kidney function, but people who have diabetes
		 generally develop hypertension before there is a measurable impact on the kidneys.</p>
		<p>Hormone conditions, thyroid disease, adrenal disease and pituitary disease produce hormonal fluctuations that lead to changes in blood pressure,
		 with hypertension being one of the common outcomes of these conditions.</p>

		<div id="bptreatment">
		<h2><p style="color:#ff0000;">How hypertension is treated</p></h2>
		</div>	

		<div id="pbptreatment">
		<p>Hypertension can be effectively treated with lifestyle modification, medication and natural remedies which includes but is not limited to
			 the following:</p>
		</div> 

		<div id="smokingcessation">
		<h3><p style="color: #ff0000;">1:Smoking Cessation</p></h3>
		</div>	

		<div id="tsmokingcessation">
		<p>Smoking is one of the leading factors that causes and worsens hypertension. If you smoke and have hypertension, you  may experience a 
			substantial improvement in your blood pressure if you quit.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="weightloss"> 
		<h3><p style="color: #ff0000;">2: Weight Loss</p></h3>
		</div>

		<div id="tweightloss">
		<p>If you are overweight, losing weight can help reduce your blood pressure. With some persistence , most people can do so using a combination of
		 diet and exercise. Bariatric  surgery, which may be necessary for some individuals, has also been shown to improve hypertension.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="dietarymodification">
		<h3><p style="color: #ff0000;">3: Dietary Modification</p></h3>
		</div>

		<div id="tdietarymodification">
		<p>Foods that are high in water content, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, help maintain fluid and electrolyte balance,
		 which can help keep blood pressure at an ideal level. Fruits and veggies also contain antioxidants
		 which help prevent damage to your blood vessels and related vascular disease, which often prevents hypertension.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="exercise">
		<h3><p style="color: #ff0000;">4: Exercise</p></h3>
		</div>

		<div id="texercise">
		<p>Regular physical activity can help maintain optimal blood pressure, even if you do not need to exercise for weight loss. The cardiovascular,
		 hormonal and cholesterol changes that result from exercise are all believed to contribute to maintaining a healthy blood pressure.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="lowsalt">
		<h3><p style="color: #ff0000;">5: Low Salt</p></h3>
		</div>

		<div id="tlowsalt">
		<p>A diet that is low in sodium can help lower your blood pressure. Excess salt has been shown to increase blood pressure for some people,
		 but not for everyone.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="prescriptions">
		<h3><p style="color: #ff0000;">6: Prescriptions</p></h3>
		</div>

		<div id="tprescriptions">

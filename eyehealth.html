		<p>Healthy eyes and good vision are important for your quality of life. But even though you may think you are seeing your best and your eyes do not
		 have any noticeable symptoms of disease, they may not be as healthy as they could be. Having an annual eye exam is the best way to protect your eye
		 health. There are also other steps you can take to prevent common eye and vision problems. Taking care not only of your eyes but your body as a 
		 whole will help keep your vision sharp and support your ocular health through the years.</p>
		<p>Factors that affect your eye health that you can have some influence on include:</p>
		<ol type="1">
		<li><span style= "font-weight: bold;color:#ff0000;">Proper nutrition: </span>Your eyes rely on vitamins and nutrients to protect against blinding eye diseases 
		such as age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma.</li>
		<li><span style = "font-weight: bold;color:#ff0000;">Exposures:</span> Eye damage can result from ultraviolet radiation (UV) from the sun2 as well as toxic chemical 
		exposures at home or on the job.</li>
		<li><span style="font-weight: bold; color:#ff0000;">Smoking:</span> Tobacco smoke increases the risk of several eye conditions that can lead to blindness.</li>
		<li><span style="font-weight: bold;color:#ff0000;">Health conditions: </span>High blood pressure, diabetes, and other issues increase your risk of eye disease and vision loss.4 You may be predisposed
		 to these conditions, but lifestyle choices you make can influence their management.</li>
		<li><span style="font-weight: bold;color:#ff0000;">Trauma: </span>This may happen unexpectedly, as with a car accident, or as a result of an activity that carries such risk, such as playing a sport, 
		or working in a profession such as welding, which carries a higher risk of eye injury due to metallic foreign bodies.</li>
		<li><span style="font-weight: bold;color:#ff0000;">Infections: </span>Your eyes can also be at risk from infections due to improper handling of contact lenses, exposure to contaminated water, 
		  viral or bacterial contamination</li>

		</div>

		<div id="eyeexaminationparagraph">
		<p>Scheduling an annual eye exam is one of the most important steps you can take in protecting your eyes and vision. In addition, the eyes provide
		 hints about your overall health, which could lead you to discover a concern that you might not have otherwise (or at least as soon).</p>
		<p> Here are the top three reasons you should schedule an appointment:</p>
		<ol type = "1">
		<li><span style="color:#ff0000;">To test your visual acuity: </span>This needs to be checked on a regular basis to make sure you are seeing as well as you could be. Annoying 
		headaches or general fatigue are often caused by slight over- or under-correction of your prescription (or a lack of correction entirely).</li>
		<li><span style="color:#ff0000;">To check for eye disease: </span>Many serious eye diseases often have no symptoms. For example, cataracts often 
		develop so gradually that you may not even realize your vision has decreased. Early detection of eye diseases is important for maintaining healthy
		 vision.</li>
		<li><span style="color: #ff0000;">To reveal developmental problems: </span>Uncorrected vision problems in children often cause learning and reading difficulties, or contribute to other 
		medical problems such as dyslexia and ADD. Uncorrected vision in children can often cause amblyopia (lazy eye) or strabismus (eye turn), which can 
		cause permanent vision loss if not treated early in life.</li>
